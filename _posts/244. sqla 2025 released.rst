title: SQLAlchemy 2.0.25 Released
author: Mike

SQLAlchemy 2.0.25 is now available.

This release includes a fix for an issue found in the asyncio system, where an
engine that's been disposed using the ``Engine.dispose()`` method, as would
be done when moving the engine across a process boundary, then used
again for new connectivity, would inadvertently use a ``threading.Lock``
internally which can cause deadlocks when used in an asyncio context.

The release also includes a "preview" backport of the asyncio-compatible
dialect for Oracle using the newly introduced asyncio support in the
``oracledb`` DBAPI library.

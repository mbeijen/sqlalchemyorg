title: SQLAlchemy 2.0.9 Released

SQLAlchemy release 2.0.9 is now available.

Release 2.0.9 is an emergency release which includes a critical fix for
SQL Server.  The "insertmanyvalues" feature has been temporarily disabled for this
backend, as a behavior has been identified in SQL Server itself which under
some circumstances will cause the multi-row INSERT statement to insert
rows in a non-deterministic order vs. the order in which they are
indicated in the parameter list, which can lead to incorrect persistence
decisions specific to the ORM unit of work process.    An upcoming release
will restore "insertmanyvalues" to SQL Server and also adjust the unit of work
process to not rely upon the feature in this way; the feature will be fully
supported for operations such as "bulk insert".

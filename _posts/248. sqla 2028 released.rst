SQLAlchemy 2.0.28 is now available.

Release 2.0.28 includes two ORM related regression fixes, one of which is
a performance regression regarding ORM "criteria" options such as
the ``with_expression()`` construct as well as when adding WHERE criteria
to loader options such as ``selectinload()``.   The replacement approach
is significantly simpler and may have a noticeable effect for applications
which encounter this specific codepath / scenario.

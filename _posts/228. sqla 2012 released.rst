SQLAlchemy 2.0.12 is now available.

Release 2.0.12 includes a critical bugfix in the SQL caching system, also
backported to version 1.4.48, where SQL expressions that made use of
``hybrid_property()`` in conjunction with the ORM ``aliased()`` construct would
not be appropriately cached, leading to memory issues. All applications that
make use of these constructs are strongly encouraged to upgrade to 2.0.12.

SQLAlchemy 2.0.12 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.

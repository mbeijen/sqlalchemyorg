SQLAlchemy 2.0.18 is now available.

Release 2.0.18 includes a variety of bug fixes within the Core and dialect
components as well as some typing related fixes. An additional SQL caching
related issue involving the ``regexp_match()`` and ``regexp_replace()``
functions is fixed; for users of these two functions, release 1.4.49 fixes a
critical issue that prevented the engine-level SQL cache from operating
effectively when these constructs were in use.

SQLAlchemy release 2.0.10 is now available.

Release 2.0.10 revisits the original reason that version 2.0.9 was released
quickly, involving apparent row ordering when using RETURNING with
SQLAlchemy 2.0's "insertmanyvalues" feature, which had to be disabled for
Microsoft SQL Server.

In version 2.0.10, "insertmanyvalues" has gained a new optional RETURNING
feature called ``sort_by_parameter_order`` which enables a new set of INSERT
forms and execution models which ensure these ordering guarantees take place
for each of the supported backends SQL Server, PostgreSQL, SQLite and MariaDB.
As a result the "insertmanyvalues" performance optimization is re-enabled for
SQL Server. For other backends, while no row-ordering issues were observed or
reproduced, the new guarantees change how the feature is implemented as used by
the ORM. A new documentation section linked from the changelog illustrates the
feature in depth.

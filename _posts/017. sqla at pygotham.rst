title: SQLAlchemy at PyGotham
---
This is a talk given at PyGotham 2011 in New York City.   In this talk, I get into
my latest thinking on SQLAlchemy's usage philosophy and cover a few architectural features
that I discuss in my upcoming chapter for the book `Architecture of Open Source Applications <http://www.aosabook.org/>`_.
Here's the slides in PDF Form: `SQLAlchemy - an Architectural Retrospective <http://techspot.zzzeek.org/files/2011/sqla_arch_retro.key.pdf>`_.

SQLAlchemy release 2.0.11 is now available.

Release 2.0.11 includes a fix for a critical regression introduced in 2.0.10 as
a result of the "insertmanyvalues" refactoring, for the PostgreSQL dialects
using either the psycopg or psycopg2 drivers, which impacted floating point
data during bulk INSERT statements.

Version 2.0.11 also includes performance enhancements to the ``Row``
construct as well as other fixes for the ORM, engine, Oracle and MSSQL
components.

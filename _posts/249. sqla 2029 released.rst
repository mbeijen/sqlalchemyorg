SQLAlchemy 2.0.29 is now available.

Release 2.0.29 includes an adjustment to a behavior introdcued in 2.0.10
regarding the robustness of the new "insertmanyvalues" bulk insert feature.
This adjustment allows third party libraries that define their own primary-key
oriented datatypes, like GUID types, to work in this mode without requiring
special adjustments.  Also included are some ORM Annotated Declarative fixes,
pep-484 typing fixes and test suite improvements, among other things.

SQLAlchemy 2.0.15 is now available.

Release 2.0.15 adds an additional regression fix related to the series of
changes for "insertmanyvalues", which uses a new SQL syntax on the
PostgreSQL backend, this time repairing support for the generic
``Uuid`` datatype for those cases where multiple ``uuid`` values would
be INSERTed by the ORM while also using RETURNING.

Links to the detailed changelog for 2.0.15 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_2_0_15>`_.

SQLAlchemy 2.0.15 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.

title: SQLAlchemy 1.4.49 Released
author: Mike
---

SQLAlchemy 1.4.49 is now available.

Release 1.4.49 establishes compatibility with the upcoming Python 3.12
release, as well as aligns the mypy plugin for MyPy 1.4 recently released.
An additional SQL caching related issue involving the ``regexp_match()``
and ``regexp_replace()`` functions is fixed; for users of these two functions,
release 1.4.49 fixes a critical issue that prevented the engine-level SQL cache from
operating effectively when these constructs were in use.

The complete changelog for 1.4.49 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_4_49>`_.

SQLAlchemy 1.4.49 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.

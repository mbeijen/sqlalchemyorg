title: SQLAlchemy 1.4.48 Released
author: Mike
---

SQLAlchemy 1.4.48 is now available.

Release 1.4.48 includes a critical bugfix in the SQL caching system, backported
from version 2.0.12, where SQL expressions that made use of
``hybrid_property()`` in conjunction with the ORM ``aliased()`` construct would
not be appropriately cached, leading to memory issues. All applications that
make use of these constructs are strongly encouraged to upgrade to 1.4.48 (the
same fix is in the 2.0 series at version 2.0.12).

The complete changelog for 1.4.48 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_4_48>`_.

SQLAlchemy 1.4.48 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.

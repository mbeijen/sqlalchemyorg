SQLAlchemy 2.0.24 is now available.

Release 2.0.24 includes a significant number of bug fixes and improvements.
Changes to be particularly aware of include a fix to the
``URL.render_as_string()`` method to repair for escaping of particular characters
that previously would not "round trip" through a URL->string->URL loop,
full pep-484 typing has been implemented for the ``sqlalchemy.sql.functions``
module, and the ``async_fallback()`` function used for test suites is now
deprecated.

title: SQLAlchemy 1.4.51 Released
author: Mike

SQLAlchemy 1.4.51 is now available.

This release includes a fix for an issue found in the asyncio system, where an
engine that's been disposed using the ``Engine.dispose()`` method, as would
be done when moving the engine across a process boundary, then used
again for new connectivity, would inadvertently use a ``threading.Lock``
internally which can cause deadlocks when used in an asyncio context.

The complete changelog for 1.4.51 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_4_51>`_.

SQLAlchemy 1.4.51 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.

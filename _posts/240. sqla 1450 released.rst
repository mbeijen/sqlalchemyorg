SQLAlchemy 1.4.50 is now available.

Release 1.4.50 is a late 1.4-series release to keep up with a small number
of bug fixes that have been backported from the 2.0 series.  It includes a
fix for a new warning that's being emitted by some MySQL native client
libraries regarding the argument signature for the ``ping()`` command,
when the "pool pre-ping" feature of the engine is used.
